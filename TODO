A DFA generator will accept a 5 tuple that consists of a set of states,
an alphabet set, a transition function, an initial state and a set of final states.
It will return a DFA which in turn can determine whether a alphabet is in that language or not.
Please ensure that the 5 tuple can be specified as a JSON object in a file.
The transition function can be written as a transition table:
ex:
q1,1,q1
q1,0,q2
...
...
